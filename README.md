# ProxyChecker
You can use this tool to check proxies with port 80. We put the online proxy tool in a file and it gives it to you
Using this tool is very easy!
All you have to do is provide the list proxy file to the program and use it
I made this tool Python myself so you can use its code. Because the program does not have complex codes!
For example, we want to give the file address :

ProxyList.txt
